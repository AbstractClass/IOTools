# IOTools

A simple library for reading and writing from a structured variable (dict, list array, etc) to common filetypes like csv or json.

It is often required in projects to read and write to json files for things like config files or application persistence, however in Python, this requires much boilerplate code and can be tedious to write and handle correctly.  With this in mind I wrote a library that simplifies the process down to single functions for reading and writing for each filetype/variable-type, and a factory-function to produce them.

Running IOTools.py will give a rudementary example of the current functions and how they work.

Feel free to use this code for your own projects, I just ask that you please give credit back to my github in your code/final-product.
